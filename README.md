# 🌤️ Weather App

I built this simple weather app using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS 4**. It allows users to type in a city name and, on clicking the search button, fetches and displays the current weather details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and location using the **OpenWeather API**. I used React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` to manage the app’s state, lifecycle, and input reference. The UI is responsive and styled completely with Tailwind CSS. To run the project, you just need to install the dependencies, add your OpenWeather API key in a `.env` file as `VITE_API_KEY`, and start the dev server with `npm run dev`.
